    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my web page! Here I'd like to display navigation, my name and title, one welcoming line. In mobile view, the navigation should stick to the top and follow the page.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="about me">
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'd like to give some background about myself, highlighting my skills and experience, perhaps giving a bit about my origins and military experience</p>
  </section>
  <section id="portfolio">
    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p>Here I might use cards or some other nice way of displaying succinct pictures and text pairs each representing a linkable project that represents my past work. Two rows of 3 cards in desktop mode, one column of cards in mobile. A mouseover of the thumbnails should cause the thumbnail to come to life, perhaps previewing interesting parts of the project or changing size.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="contact">
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>A simple contact form for prospective employers, peers, or fans to reach out. In mobile, the instructional text should slide to above the form.</p>
