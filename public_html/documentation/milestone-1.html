        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <div id="name">
            <p><b>Name:</b> Jacob Davidson</p>
        </div>
        <div id="age">
            <p><b>Age:</b> 34</p>
        </div>
        <div id="profession">
            <p><b>Profession:</b> He is a junior partner of a small law firm. Recently his mentor, the owner of the firm, passed away, leaving an estate to fight over, a business to run, and decades worth of clients to reconcile with. Currently, his main method of attracting new clientele is using social media and word-of-mouth. However, he would like a more centralized site that accurately represents his work, client testimonials, and of course supplies a user-friendly contact form, as well as a way for potential partners and employees to reach out.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="technology">
            <p><b>Technology:</b> He is an average user with outdated PCs and a laptop running Windows 10 and an Android Smart phone. He uses technology to stay connected with news and social media. He is especially active on Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="attitude">
            <p><b>Attitudes and Behaviors:</b> Short on time, overworked, and also has personal drama to contend with. He often misses phone appointments and social events due to being run down and overwhelmed.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="frustrations">
            <p><b>Frustrations and Needs:</b> He is frustrated by how jam-packed his schedule is and feels like he has to do everything himself for it to be done right. He needs to automate some of the processes that he generally performs manually. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="goals">
            <p><b>Goals:</b> Jacob envisions that a business website will provide additional tools to streamline his business workflow. He has identified that he spends a majority of his time communicating, and is hoping there is a way to get some of that time back in the realm of technology. Additionally, he is hoping to vet potential partners to help balance his workload and perhaps expand his business capabilities, so some type of job placement forms on his site would be essential.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="story">
            <p><b>User Story:</b> Jacob is an excellent lawyer, and generally an intelligent person, but he has always depended on his own talent and hard work to perform the functions that make him successful. What he is looking for is someone he trusts that is tech savvy to analyze his workflow and find analogs that a computer could perform.</p>
